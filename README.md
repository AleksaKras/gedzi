This is my Telegram Bot for a GPark . 
The main idea of this bot is a quiz, which bot makes for visitors. 
It asks questions, and users should find answers by reading legends, which located in different places in this Park. There are 5 ways of legends, 8 questions and for 4 answers in each. 

All users and their data are connected to the MongoDB base, which store all info and progress about everyone. If users make 7-8/8 right answers - they will get a special prize from the Park. 

For get the prize - people should show manager special sticker, which you cannot copy or forward by protect content. So 1 sticker - 1 person - 1 prize. 
If you get less than 7+ right answers - you cannot get this prize and also remake the quiz - because you are already in the DataBase like a user, which have passed the test at least 1 time.

Around 1k users have done the quiz since September 2024. 
Keep going and have ideas for remake the main part of the code for better and faster using it, also for async proccess when a lot of people use it in one moment.
